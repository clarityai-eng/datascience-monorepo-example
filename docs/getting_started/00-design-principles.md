## Zen of Python

The project follows the [Zen of Python](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0020/). The most important ones to follow in this project are:

- Explicit is better than implicit.
- Simple is better than complex.
- Practicality beats purity.
- In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.
