# Notebooks as documentation

As part of documentation efforts, we can include Jupyter Notebook as documentation in the project. This is a great way to share knowledge and to make it easy to reproduce results.

Ideas of things a notebook documentation is good for:

- Exploratory analysis results.
- Justify business decisions with data analysis.
- Showcase model results
- Document end to end features of the project

Any notebook placed in the `docs/` folder will be automatically included in the documentation. Keep in mind the state of the notebook once is committed to the project is what is going to be shown in the docs (an end to end run of the notebook is recommended before commit).
